# DealEngine Summer Internship: Next Steps
> [Phil Hwang](phil@dealengine.io)

Hello!

This is the bald guy from the career fair that was handing out money. If you are receiving this email, congratulations! You are one of fifteen candidates (all Bcc) who we are inviting to go through the next step in the internship process. You have differentiated yourselves with your ability to convincingly demonstrate what you bring to the table.

The next step is for you to demonstrate the skills we feel are critical for you to possess to be successful and push yourselves and our team forward.

Here is the test that we talked about.

In order to succeed here at DealEngine, you must be able to take an abstract problem, break it down into its component parts, and manage your time efficiently in the process of finding solutions. You need to thrive while working independently, hold yourself accountable without oversight, have the drive to utilize outside resources like stackoverflow and google to obtain new skills, and translate that into deliverable results. This project will serve as a fun litmus test to see if you have what it takes to work in the environment of a real early-stage tech startup.

About a year ago, I spoiled the ending of the blockbuster movie Avengers: Endgame. Back then, Case Western had rather shitty oversight on mailing lists. There were gaping security flaws where anybody could unintentionally email the entire school. When a vulnerability like this was accidentally found by some unassuming incoming freshman, the trolls of Case would keep replying all, resulting in an unintended, chaotic public forum ensnaring a captive audience.

You see, there was no way to stop the incessant ping of notifications from useless emails besides for unsubscribing from the list (difficult to do if it's something important, like the list of all student employees of CWRU) or waiting a few days for U-Tech to fix it. Incidents like these were commonly known as a reply-all-pocalypse.

I scraped the (publicly available to any CWRU student) Google Groups page to find all the mailing lists. Out of those, only a small percentage had a security flaw where everybody could post. I had to clean/analyze each scraped HTML page to figure out if it was vulnerable or not.

Because a lot of the current processes in place at DealEngine require a basic knowledge of web scraping/automation/data analytics, this is a fun, project-based way to learn a skill that's extremely useful in an era where data is the universal currency.

Here is your test:
Using web scraping and python, generate a list of at least 500 email lists here at CWRU and put them in a file. You will need to share the code that you used to do so. You do not need to look for security flaws of any sort.

I know that sounds like a pretty daunting task, considering how none of you have significant experience in web scraping. Thus, here are some helpful guidelines.

1. I used selenium and beautifulsoup. My research job from a few summers ago strongly suggested that I record an online lecture about web scraping, so you're in luck. There is a very scrappy but effective tutorial on web scraping that you can use to get started.

2. Here is the google groups page that you will have to navigate and scrape. https://groups.google.com/a/case.edu/forum/#!forumsearch/. Think about how you would do this task manually, break it down into its core components, and try to get the computer to emulate those specific tasks. Everything from clicks, form submissions, and navigating to the next page should be considered.

3. Excluding questions regarding clarification of the problem, you all get two technical questions each. I will answer two questions about whatever you want to know about this task. I will write you a maximum of five sentences for each question.

4. Uh, this is for educational purposes only. Don't do anything bad with the lists. After their security flaws were exposed in such a public manner, Case made sure that all the holes were patched up after that incident. That being said, please don't try to do anything bad. Just gathering these email lists are perfectly fine as they are public information accessible to everybody, but anything beyond that is not my responsibility.

5. Just to make sure that you are all on the right track, please schedule a call within 7 days to discuss how you would approach this project. This is an important part of the process because I will be looking at how you communicate and break down an abstract project.

6. The deadline for the project is 3 weeks from now, so on the 4th of March. If you finish the whole project, I will be very impressed. However, I'm looking more for coding practices, how you break a problem down, and what you've done. Please show me what you've done at the end of the three weeks. Aim to make significant progress that you can be proud of, not to finish this project in its entirety.

7. I understand that you are current students with a lot going on. Tests, assignments, essays, clubs, friends, and family are all factors that go into consideration when deciding what to do with your time. What you do with your time is completely your choice.

I am looking forward to being impressed by your talents! Everything that you would have constant access to during the summer is fair game (google, books, advice from reliable people, etc)

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions! If it's a technical question ("what's wrong with my code," I will consider that using one of your two questions).

Good luck, have fun!
